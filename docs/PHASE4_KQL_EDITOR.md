### ⚡ Query Execution Engine  
- Application Insights API integration with OAuth2 authentication
- Query validation including table name verification and bracket matching
- Configurable timeout handling (default: 30 seconds)
- Comprehensive error formatting with user-friendly messages

### 📊 Dynamic Results Display
- Adaptive table columns based on KQL `project` statements
- Professional rendering with proper column sizing and overflow handling
- Type-aware formatting for timestamps, numbers, JSON objects
- Support for large result sets with memory-efficient handling

### 📚 Query History Management
- Persistent storage to secure local JSON file (permissions 0600)
- Configurable maximum entries (default: 100)
- Success/failure tracking with execution time and row count metrics
- Navigation through history using Ctrl+↑/↓ keyboard shortcuts

### 🎛️ Command Palette Integration
- `query` - Open KQL editor in split-screen mode
- `query run` - Execute current query (alternative to F5)
- `query clear` - Clear editor content
- `query history` - Display history information

### 🎨 Professional UI/UX
- Split-screen layout with configurable editor/results ratio (default: 40/60)
- Tab key navigation between editor and results components
- Focus management with visual indicators
- Status displays for execution progress and query metrics
- Escape key to exit editor mode and return to main view

appinsights/
└── client.go            # Enhanced with query execution & validation

config/
└── config.go            # Extended with KQL editor settings
```

### Configuration Extensions
New configurable settings with environment variable support:
- `queryHistoryMaxEntries` - Maximum stored queries (default: 100)
- `queryTimeoutSeconds` - Query execution timeout (default: 30)
- `queryHistoryFile` - History storage file (default: .bc-insights-query-history.json)
- `editorPanelRatio` - Editor/results split ratio (default: 0.4)

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Authentication Errors**: Clear guidance to re-authenticate
- **Syntax Errors**: Line-specific feedback with correction hints  
- **API Errors**: User-friendly explanations with suggested actions
- **Timeout Errors**: Guidance to simplify queries or reduce time range
- **Permission Errors**: Clear Azure configuration instructions

## User Workflow

### Opening KQL Editor
1. Press `Ctrl+P` to open command palette
2. Type `query` and press Enter
3. KQL editor opens in split-screen mode with editor focused

### Writing and Executing Queries
1. Type KQL query in multi-line editor with line numbers
2. Use Ctrl+↑/↓ to browse query history  
3. Press F5 to execute query
4. Results appear in dynamic table below editor
5. Use Tab to switch focus between editor and results

### Example KQL Query Workflow
```kql
traces
| where timestamp >= ago(1h)
| where customDimensions.eventId == "RT0019"
| project timestamp, severityLevel, message,
    alUser = tostring(customDimensions.alUser),
    alObjectType = tostring(customDimensions.alObjectType)
| order by timestamp desc
| limit 100
```

### Navigation and Management
- **Tab**: Switch between editor and results table
- **Ctrl+↑/↓**: Navigate through query history
- **Ctrl+K**: Clear current editor content
- **Esc**: Exit KQL editor and return to main view
- **F5**: Execute current query

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- **Query History**: Entry management, max limits, persistence, navigation
- **KQL Editor**: Focus management, content handling, keyboard shortcuts
- **Application Insights Client**: Query validation, syntax checking, API structures
- **Integration**: Full workflow testing with existing authentication system

### Test Files Added
- `tui/query_history_test.go` - History management functionality
- `tui/kql_editor_test.go` - Editor component behavior  
- `appinsights/client_test.go` - API client validation

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Efficiency
- Query results stored as interface{} slices for flexibility
- History limited to configurable maximum entries
- Lazy loading of UI components
- Efficient string handling for large queries

### Execution Performance
- Query validation before API calls to prevent unnecessary requests
- Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging operations
- Responsive UI during query execution
- Memory-efficient handling of large result sets

## Business Central Integration

### Telemetry Schema Support
- Dynamic column adaptation for varying `customDimensions` schemas
- Support for all standard Application Insights tables (traces, requests, dependencies, exceptions)
- Event ID-based query patterns for Business Central specific analysis
- Proper handling of BC-specific fields like `alUser`, `alObjectType`, etc.

### Common Query Patterns
The editor supports common Business Central analysis patterns:
- Error tracking and exception analysis
- Performance monitoring with duration metrics
- User session analysis
- Custom event correlation
- AL object performance analysis

## Next Steps (Phase 5 Preparation)

The KQL Editor implementation provides the foundation for Phase 5 AI-powered features:
- Query structure supports AI-generated KQL
- History system ready for AI query suggestions
- Editor framework supports syntax highlighting and auto-completion
- Results display ready for AI-powered insights and recommendations

## Summary

Phase 4 successfully delivers a complete, production-ready KQL query editor that transforms bc-insights-tui into a comprehensive Business Central analytics platform. The implementation maintains the project's command palette-driven philosophy while providing professional-grade query composition and execution capabilities.

The architecture is designed for extensibility, setting the stage for Phase 5 AI-powered features while delivering immediate value through a full-featured KQL editing experience.
