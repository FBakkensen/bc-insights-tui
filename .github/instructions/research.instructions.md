# Research Project Context and Coding Guidelines
Always do proper research before starting any coding task. This includes understanding the problem.
- use context7
- perplexity
- use the github tools to search code in the bubbles repo https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles
- use the github tools to search code in the bubbletea repo https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea
- always read the documentation in the `docs/` directory
Do your research as the first thing when starting a new task in your todo list.
